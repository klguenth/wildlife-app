# Wildlife Watch

## Summary

Wildlife watch is a fullstack CRUD app that provides users with the opportunity to create and maintain a list of wildlife sightings- specifically noting species, behavior, location, and date. 

## Motivation

Wildlife Watch centers on animal behavior and observation, with the hope that it will foster curiosity about the natural world to ultimately inspire wildlife conservation efforts. The creator of the app has worked with a wide variety of animals- specifically marine mammals- in a previous career, so the emphasis on wildlife conservation and habitat preservation were a large part of the inspiration behind the app. After all, as the landing page states:
> 
In the end we will conserve only what we love; we will love only what we understand; we will understand only what we are taught. -Baba Dioum
